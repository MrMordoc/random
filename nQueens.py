numQueens is a function to solve the n-queens problem of how many ways can you fill a 
chessboard with queens so that none can attack each other.
The board is represented by a list of numbers. Each index in the list represents a row on the
chessboard, and the value at that index represents the column.
This solution was coded by Ron Fenolio
